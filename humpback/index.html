        <p>
            Humpback whales are a species of whale named for their distinctive shape. 
            They are known for jumping out of the ocean in an act called breaching. Humpbacks can often be seen playing
            at the surface of the water. Their calls are long and songlike. The main natural predators of humpbacks are orcas. 
            Humpbacks live in small groups and coordinate hunts together. Some humpbacks use a technique called bubble-net feeding.
            This involves multiple humpbacks blowing bubbles to disorient prey.
